 This is the working prototype of  Mistral 7-B Instruct fine tuned model.
 It will work on cpu and please make sure that you have some space allocated for downloading the model on your local system.
 The required space is about 5GB. 
 If you have GPU you can mention gpu layers and need to write a little bit of code.
Make sure you have python.
It's just a small prototype model and we are going to convert this into JS.
