There are five links to different pages in the navigation bar of the index page. The home and FitAsses (for fitness metrics) are completely done. The workouts page has been started, and it can take workouts as input, but sets and reps for those workouts have yet to be done. There are two more pages called community that we are about to work on. A community page has to be created for people who have the same goals for the workout, to share achievements, etc. The About page tells stuff about the product.
